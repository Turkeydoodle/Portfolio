    <h4>I have a passion for gaming, for many reasons that I may share with many others. I use it to detox and relax, as
        well as a way to entertain myself. I enjoy
        playing many different games, on different platforms. Some of my favorite games include Hollow Knight, Call of
        Duty (Warzone), and various Nintendo games. <br> I got into the hobby in early 2020, and have been enjoying it
        ever since. I have hundreds of hours inside of
        many different games, and have been learning about game design and mechanics. I hope to
        be able to expand my knowledge and skills in this area, and maybe even create a game myself one day!
