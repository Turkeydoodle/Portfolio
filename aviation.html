    <h4>I have a passion for aviation, both as a hobby and a potential career path (if the pay is good!). I enjoy
        learning about different aircraft, flight mechanics, and the aviation industry as a whole. Whether it's
        watching planes take off and land at the airport or reading up on the latest advancements in aviation
        technology, I find it all fascinating.<br>Additionally, I like to listen into air traffic control in my area,
        as it is interesting to see the planes on the flight map adjust to what the air traffic controller is saying.
        <br> I got into the hobby in late 2024, and have been enjoying it ever since. I have hundreds of hours inside of
        many different flight simulators, and have been learning about aviation history and technology. I hope to
        be able to expand my knowledge and skills in this area, and maybe even fly a plane myself one day!
